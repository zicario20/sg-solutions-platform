# Security Architecture

- Owner: Codex Architecture Agent
- Security approver: Product Owner until a delegated security owner is appointed
- Status: Phase 0 approved baseline with open policy decisions in module PRDs
- Update rule: update for every identity, authorization, storage, payment, encryption, retention,
  integration or sensitive-data change

## Core controls

- Identity, internal role and resource access are separate controls.
- Email matching, UI hiding or client status never grants resource access.
- Case grants may inherit only to client-visible child resources under ADR 004.
- Internal resources fail closed; highly sensitive documents may require additional explicit access.
- Authorization executes in domain services and Postgres RLS, with Storage policies for objects.
- Private files use quarantine, content validation, malware scanning, promotion and short-lived
  signed URLs under `FILE_UPLOAD_SECURITY.md`.
- Drizzle is the sole authority for schemas, indexes, RLS policies and migrations.
- Secrets remain in approved environment/secret stores, never source control.
- Stripe webhooks are signature-verified, idempotent, repeatable and reconciled.
- Logs, analytics, traces and error reports exclude sensitive documents, identifiers, tax/credit
  data, notes, portal free text, raw request bodies and secrets.

## Data and cryptography

`DATA_CLASSIFICATION.md` controls storage, access, telemetry, retention and deletion. ADR 005 defines
application-level envelope encryption for selected Highly Sensitive structured fields and separates
it from provider-managed encryption at rest. Full payment-card data is never stored or processed by
SG Solutions application code.

## Defense in depth

Authorization is checked before queries, encoded in RLS and applied to Storage objects. Every
sensitive read, export, download, grant, revocation, role change, payment mutation and destructive
administrative action emits a minimized audit event. Audit events record who, what, when, result and
correlation identifiers without copying protected content.

## Enhanced review boundary

Authentication, MFA, sessions, RBAC/RLS, client grants, Storage, uploads, encryption, payments,
financial reconciliation, sensitive data, telemetry, AI data access, migrations, CI/deploy and
recovery require independent security review. Cyber Neo remains strictly read-only and supplements,
but never replaces, professional legal/compliance review.

## Incident readiness

Security incidents use a safe manual path: contain access, revoke sessions/credentials, preserve
audit evidence, isolate affected data, notify the Product Owner, assess legal obligations, restore
from validated recovery points if needed and document lessons learned. Detailed provider playbooks
are created before each sensitive integration reaches its Release gate.
